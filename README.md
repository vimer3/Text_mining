📊🌟 Sentiment Analysis on Yelp Reviews
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of Yelp reviews, focusing on sentiment classification using various techniques and models. 🔍💬
🔑 Key Components:
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Analysis 🧹📊
Our journey begins with thorough cleaning of review text and visualization of review distributions and characteristics. We employ various techniques to prepare our data for analysis and gain initial insights.
2️⃣ Traditional Machine Learning Approaches 🤖🎯
We implement Naive Bayes and Linear SVC models as our baseline approaches. Additionally, we utilize VADER sentiment analysis to set a benchmark for our more advanced models.
3️⃣ Neural Network Models 🧠⚡
The heart of our project lies in exploring various neural network architectures. We dive deep into LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), Bidirectional LSTM, and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) models. These powerful networks are applied to both binary and multi-class sentiment classification tasks.
4️⃣ Transformer-Based Approach 🚀💡
Taking a step into cutting-edge technology, we fine-tune DistilBERT for sentiment analysis. This approach harnesses the power of contextual embeddings to capture nuanced sentiments in the reviews.
5️⃣ Performance Evaluation 📊🏆
We conduct a comprehensive comparison of all implemented models. Our analysis includes crucial metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-score, Accuracy, and ROC, providing a holistic view of each model's performance.
